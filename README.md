In this analysis, I explored a heart disease dataset consisting of 1025 rows and 14 columns, covering various health indicators. First, I examined the dataset for any missing values and confirmed there were none. I then separated the data into dependent (target) and independent variables.

Using a logistic regression model, I trained the model on the training data and evaluated its performance on the test data. Although I encountered a convergence warning suggesting that the maximum number of iterations was reached, the model still performed reasonably well. The accuracy was 78%, with balanced precision and recall scores for both classes. The confusion matrix highlighted areas for improvement, specifically in reducing false positives and false negatives.

Overall, this analysis provided a foundational understanding of predicting heart disease using logistic regression, with potential for further refinement and optimization.
